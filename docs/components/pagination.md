# Pagination

## 1. Title and support strip

Move through a bounded result set with a clear position and range. Stable ID: `SWC-pagination`; source IDs: P14, S5, L3, B. Maturity: **proposed**; availability: **documented reference**, not a published component package. Owner: Space Works design-system owner, Shaan Shoukath; product maintainers own app integration. Documentation introduced/updated for **v2.1.0, planned** under decision 397. Last source verification: **2026-11-13**. Web implementation is described below; Compose/SwiftUI are starter mappings with **no verified component parity**.

## 2. Use it for / choose something else

Use for paginated lists/tables. Use a named Load more action when totals are unknown; it needs a separate accumulation contract. Do not show a pager for one page.

**Extracted source contract:** [P14 — P14. Tables inside a card (R4, R8, R10)](../ux-spec.md#p14-tables-inside-a-card-r4-r8-r10) · [S5 — S5. Inventory list (`inventory`) ← R2 header/stat cards + adapted dense table (§5)](../ux-spec.md#s5-inventory-list-inventory--r2-headerstat-cards--adapted-dense-table-5) · [L3 — L3. `ListLayout` — header + callout + stats/tabs + filters + list/table + pagination (R2, R4)](../ux-spec.md#l3-listlayout--header--callout--statstabs--filters--listtable--pagination-r2-r4) · [B — B. Interaction states](../ui-brand-spec.md#b-interaction-states). The purpose, anatomy, variants and dimensions below condense those sections without moving their IDs or anchors. Source P rules describe observed reference boards; B/C and later decisions resolve brand adaptations.

[Authority and implementation status](README.md#authority-and-implementation-status) gives precedence. [Source inventory](source-inventory.json) preserves headings, table cells, code and links for publication checks.

## 3. Live example and complete code

[Full-page runnable example](../../examples/web/component-gallery.html#pagination): start `node examples/web/server.mjs` from the repository root, then open `http://localhost:4174/examples/web/component-gallery.html#pagination`. Choose Light/Dark, preview width and an applicable state; exercise hover, pressed and focus-visible with real input. Complete source: [HTML](../../examples/web/component-gallery.html), [behaviour](../../examples/web/gallery.mjs), [styles](../../examples/web/styles.css). No app module, network API or build step is required. These are portable reference compositions, not replicas of app exports.

```html
<nav aria-label="Pagination"><span>1–24 of 248</span><button type="button" disabled>Previous</button><span>Page 1 of 11</span><button type="button" data-page-next>Next</button></nav>
```

The linked shell supplies CSS/tokens and any `data-*` behaviour. Static text/native controls remain without JavaScript; modal content has an inline fallback. Copy the complete source for enhancements, not this fragment alone. [First-screen setup](../adoption/plain-html-css.md) shows the whole document.

## 4. Anatomy

Numbered reading-order diagram: `[1] → [2] → [3] → [4]`. Slots and name ownership:

1. Navigation landmark named Pagination.
2. Optional range text: first–last of count.
3. Previous and Next native buttons.
4. Current page of total pages text.

## 5. Variants

Page-only label or count+pageSize range context. Whole pager disabled during loading; first/last buttons separately disabled at boundaries. It returns null when totalPages<=1.

| Variant | Choose it for |
| --- | --- |
| Page only | Known page count without row total. |
| Range + page | Known count and pageSize; show first–last of count. |
| Single/zero page | No pager; parent supplies range/result state. |

Native products use platform controls with mapped roles/settings. A web keyboard model does not establish native parity. Gallery variants/states are reference compositions, not undocumented app props.

## 6. States

State handling belongs either to this primitive or the containing task explicitly named below. N/A records a semantic or API limitation, not an omitted requirement.

| State | Presentation / copy | Action, focus, announcement and data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default | Required visible name, correct role and truthful current value/context. | Enabled actions follow §8; no automatic announcement for static content. |
| Hover | Use B hover roles without hiding the label or necessary boundary. | No hover-exclusive instructions; child controls retain their own contracts. |
| Pressed | Use B active colours during activation; do not mutate on pointer-down. | Native click/release activates once; optional child actions use Button. |
| Focus-visible | Visible 2 px ring plus offset; ≥3:1 against actual adjacent colour. | Keep focused actions visible above sticky chrome and the software keyboard. |
| Selected | N/A — page position is text, not a selectable page-number control. | Previous/Next request a new page. |
| Disabled | Explicit surface/muted/line colours and an understandable prerequisite. | Use native disabled where supported; aria-disabled requires event guards. Consult §11 for unsupported props. |
| Read-only | N/A — no read-only component mode; noneditable information already reads as text. | No read-only API is claimed. For a locked choice, present a labelled static value; native checkbox/radio/select do not honour readOnly. |
| Loading / pending | Keep context; use task-specific pending copy such as “Saving…”. | Disable only the mutation in progress, announce once and preserve drafts. Fetch state is product-owned unless §11 says otherwise. |
| Empty | totalPages<=1: component renders nothing. | Parent supplies zero/single-page range and result state. |
| Filtered-empty | “No items match your filters. Clear filters above.” | Preserve query and scope, offer Clear filters and announce the result once. |
| Error / retry | “Couldn’t save/load. Try again.” plus persistent explanation and specific recovery. | Keep the user’s value/context, relate field errors by ID and retry only the failed operation. |
| Offline | Keep clearly labelled last-known values and unsent drafts; explain network-only limitations. | Local navigation/editing/Close can remain available. Product owns safe retry/idempotency; queued is not completed. |
| Success | Show the completed effect and truthful updated value; use precise confirmation. | Announce once without taking focus; visible in-place changes need no redundant toast or invented success prop. |
| Interrupted work | Retain safe drafts/context and say whether completion is known or still unresolved. | Reconcile server/session state before repeating a mutation; never automatically replay irreversible work. |

## 7. Specifications and tokens

Wrap the action row at 320 px, preserve 44 px targets and explicit disabled colours. Range moves to the start with room for translation. A single-page range must be supplied by the parent because this component renders nothing.

Load [tokens CSS](../../tokens/tokens.css) once. Theme pairs: `bg/surface/panel` with `ink` or `muted`; fills use matching `on-*`; standalone links/essential accent marks use `accent-ink` or `brand-boundary`. `line` is decorative. No alpha text or opacity-based disabled state. `outline` on hover and raw dark `accent` on panel need special contrast care; use the tested functional boundary role. Geometry described here is a source contract, not a claim that new CSS variables exist. Wrap translation and enlarged text; use min-inline-size:0 and 320 CSS px reflow rather than clipping.

## 8. Interaction / accessibility

Tab reaches enabled Previous/Next; Enter/Space requests that page. Keep focus on the initiating control when data refreshes; if it becomes disabled or the pager disappears, move to a meaningful results heading after the request, not to body. Announce the loaded range once.

| Key / input | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Tab / Enter / Space | Visit enabled Previous/Next and request the new page; parent preserves result focus. |

Test name/role/value and reading order with a screen reader. The name contains the visible label. Associate errors with unique description IDs and announce status once without moving focus. Test both themes, 400% zoom, forced colours and reduced motion. Use system colours/visible borders in forced colours; do not suppress adaptation by default. Keep focus clear of sticky chrome. The house target is 44 px; WCAG minimum is 24×24 CSS px with exceptions. Provide click/tap alternatives to dragging. Native integrations test TalkBack/VoiceOver, large type and platform focus. These are required checks, **not claims of completed AT tests**. [Accessibility](../accessibility.md) maps criteria, system contracts and product responsibilities.

## 9. Content

Use “Previous”, “Next”, “Page 2 of 11” and “25–48 of 248”. Failure says “Couldn’t load page 2. Try again.” Retain the last successful rows and truthful range until replacement succeeds.

Sentence case; translated labels and locale-aware plurals/numbers/dates/currency. Never expose raw error codes or invent a count. Money/evidence outcomes require actual confirmed completion and precise auditable consequences.

## 10. Do / don’t

| Do | Don’t / why |
| --- | --- |
| Keep filter/search state while paging and reset to page 1 when filters change. | Do not announce the requested range as loaded before the server succeeds. |
| Use semantic role tokens and complete visible copy. | Do not copy reference hex colours, alpha text or paid Gilroy weights: they bypass the current theme/type contract. |

## 11. Implementation

**Observed API:** `Pagination({page,totalPages,onChange,count?,pageSize?,disabled?})`. page is 1-based; count+pageSize are both needed for range. Previous/Next clamp callbacks within bounds. Caller owns fetching, valid page/total, URL synchronization and status announcements.

**App source, reference only:** [frontend/src/components/ui/Pagination.tsx](https://github.com/SpaceWorks-Labs/SpaceWorks/blob/main/frontend/src/components/ui/Pagination.tsx). Inspected in the supplied `int-stage-r2final` worktree; uncommitted content may differ from upstream main. [Implementation snapshot](implementation-snapshot.json) records exact file hashes. Neighbours: shared types, desk CSS and motion modules.

```tsx
<Pagination page={page} totalPages={11} count={248} pageSize={24}
  disabled={fetching} onChange={setPage} />
```

The snippet assumes the source app’s imports/state handlers. It is **not a standalone install**. Observed app dependencies include React 19.2, React Router 7.18, Tailwind 4.3, Lingui 6.10.1 and local motion/session modules. The [separate React starter](../adoption/react-tailwind.md) avoids these app dependencies. Preserve controlled values separately from fetched data. Only validated public/member brand roles take tenant overrides; staff chrome remains Space Works.

**Known limitations:** No pending label, live region, retry, URL or focus fallback is built in. Invalid page, negative counts and stale totals are not normalized beyond callback clamping; validate them in the product. No server or infinite-scroll behaviour is implied.

The standalone gallery uses local sample data/simulated outcomes. Without JS, ordinary content/controls and inline explanations remain; async/modal enhancements require JS. Native source is starter-only, not compiled here.

## 12. Related and maintenance

[Table](table.md) · [Button](button.md) · [EmptyState](empty-state.md). [Named patterns/layouts](../patterns/README.md) retain P1–P30/L1–L10 and screen backlinks. [Fonts/licences](../../fonts/README.md), [portable logo master](../../brand/logo-masters.svg) and [design-resource availability](../adoption/README.md#design-and-asset-resources) connect the assets; no public editable library or native component download is asserted.

Evidence: source inspection/captured hashes, not an app/site AT certificate. History: first dedicated contract for planned v2.1.0; no API removal introduced here. [Release policy](../releases/versioning.md), [migrations](../releases/migration.md) and [contribution route](../contributing-design-system.md) govern maintenance.
